## FireLens Example: Logging to CloudWatch Logs with Fluent Bit

### CloudWatch Golang Plugin vs CloudWatch C Plugin

There are two Fluent Bit output plugins for sending to Amazon CloudWatch Logs:
* Plugin name `cloudwatch`: the original golang plugin with extensive templating support, including injecting ECS metadata into log stream and group name templates. See its [documentation](https://github.com/aws/amazon-cloudwatch-logs-for-fluent-bit). This directory contains an example task definition thats demonstrates this plugin's ability to inject ECS task metadata into log group and stream names.
* Plugin name `cloudwatch_logs`: the newer and higher performance cloudwatch plugin built in C in the Fluent Bit upstream code base. It has more limited log group and stream name templating support. See its [documentation](https://docs.fluentbit.io/manual/pipeline/outputs/cloudwatch). This directory contains an example task definition for the high performance plugin without templating. The log stream name will be set to be `{log_stream_prefix}{log tag}` and [FireLens sets the log tag](https://github.com/aws/aws-for-fluent-bit/blob/mainline/troubleshooting/debugging.md#firelens-tag-and-match-pattern-and-generated-config) to be `{container name in task definition}-firelens-{task ID}`. So the log stream name for this example will be `stdout-stderr-app-firelens-{task ID}`.

#### Recommended cloudwatch_logs configuration options

To minimize the possibility of log loss when sending to CloudWatch, consider using the recommended configuration outlined in the [CloudWatch Recommendations](https://github.com/aws/aws-for-fluent-bit/issues/340) issue.

#### High throughput logging to CloudWatch Logs via multiple workers

As of AWS For Fluent Bit `2.32.0`, the `cloudwatch_logs` plugin supports high throughput logging via multiple workers. Set the `workers` option to an integer value, such as `5`, indicating the number of worker threads dedicated to processing output data to CloudWatch Logs concurrently. To optimize for high throughput logging, consider setting the number of workers the number of cores on the host. AWS For Fluent Bit `2.31.12` and prior does not support multiple workers, and `workers` should be set to `1`.

### What if I just want the raw log line from the container to appear in CloudWatch?

The example shown here is for the `cloudwatch` plugin, however, the `cloudwatch_logs` plugin has the same `log_key` option.

By default, FireLens will send a JSON event with the raw log line encapsulated in a `log` field. ECS Metadata will also be added. If you just want the raw log line, add the `log_key` option to your log configuration:

```
	"logConfiguration": {
		"logDriver":"awsfirelens",
		"options": {
			"Name": "cloudwatch",
			"region": "us-west-2",
			"log_key": "log",
			"log_group_name": "/aws/ecs/containerinsights/$(ecs_cluster)/application",
			"auto_create_group": "true",
			"log_stream_name": "$(ecs_task_id)",
			"retry_limit": "2"
		}
	},
```

This field instructs the CloudWatch plugin to only send the value of the log key. You should additionally disable ECS Metadata to prevent Fluent Bit from performing unnecessary data processing:

```
	"firelensConfiguration": {
		"type": "fluentbit",
		"options": {
			"enable-ecs-log-metadata": "false",
		}
	},
```

			"log_key": "log",
The following table shows how your logs will appear in CloudWatch with and without `log_key` and `enable-ecs-log-metadata` if "`my_sample log`" is printed to stdout:
